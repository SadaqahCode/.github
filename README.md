## 📖 About Us
**Sadaqah Code** is an Islamic open-source initiative dedicated to building high-quality, free, and accessible digital tools for Muslims worldwide. 

We believe that code can be a form of worship when it serves the community. Our mission is to provide transparent, ad-free, and community-owned software that upholds Islamic values.

> **Note:** Sadaqah Code was founded and is maintained by the **[FlagoDNA](https://flagodna.com)** team. While FlagoDNA leads the technical development, Sadaqah Code represents the spirit of community ownership and open-source contribution.
